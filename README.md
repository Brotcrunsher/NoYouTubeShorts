# What does it do?

Hides shorts elements from the YouTube UI.

# Does it steal my data?!

No. It does not collect, store, or transmit anything (including personal data). See content.js for everything this Plugin does - it's really short. In case you don't know how to read code, just paste it into ChatGPT or what ever.

# Why yet another Implementation?

Existing implementations did too much stuff. Some of them were multiple 100kb in size, while this implementation is only around 2kb. It was too much hassle to read all that stuff so I instead decided to implement this very minimal version.
